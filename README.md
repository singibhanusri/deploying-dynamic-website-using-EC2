# deploying-dynamic-website-using-EC2
Deploying a dynamic website on an EC2 virtual server involves these key steps:

1. **Provisioning**: Launch an EC2 instance with a suitable Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type based on your needs.
2. **Setup**: Access the server, install web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx), and set up a database (e.g., MySQL).
3. **Deployment**: Transfer your website files and configure the web server to serve your application. Connect to the database and test the site.
4. **Configuration**: Adjust security settings using AWS Security Groups, and ensure proper monitoring and backup strategies are in place.

This approach offers full control over your hosting environment and scalability options, but requires manual management and maintenance.
